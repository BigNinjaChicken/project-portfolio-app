                I was the first-place winner in the MU Design Competition and my project was featured
                in the Miami Game Design Senior Project Fair. It's a UE5 multiplayer game created with
                C++ where players speedrun through a randomly generated series of minigames while
                being pursued by a crazed conductor.
